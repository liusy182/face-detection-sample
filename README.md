Face Detection
==============

_Note: this example requires Xcode 6 beta 6 and iOS 7 or later._

Sample project for detecting faces from a live camera feed using Swift and Core Image API's.

Apple documentation for face detection is available [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/graphicsimaging/Conceptual/CoreImaging/ci_detect_faces/ci_detect_faces.html) for Objective-C. This project migrates the code to Swift and integrates it with a live camera feed.
